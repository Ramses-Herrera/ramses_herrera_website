            <p> I live with my mother and brother who were born in Mexico. They came to the United States when my brother was around 5 years old. Currently, my brother is 21 so they came to the United States before I was born. Thus, I was born in California. My brother and I both have green eyes, but he has a darker shade of green. I live in a rather small 2 bedroom apartment with my mother, brother, and 3 other people who rent out the second bedroom. Most recently I wanted to get a better understanding of the area of which I live in at night to see what roams the streets when most people are sleeping. So, I have been exploring, if you will, and Upon my observations, I have encountered and engaged in a series of sightings including cats chasing skunks, collecting acorns to lure in a pack of raccoons, and following police sirens in the distance. </p>
