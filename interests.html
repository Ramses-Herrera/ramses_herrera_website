    <H2> Hobbies </H2>
    <p>In my early childhood, I was really only interested in two things, running and playing videogames. I've been playing videogames since the PS3 came out, but the first console I ever played was the PS2. Over the years I've grown to love video game franchises and playing with friends online. I enjoy playing video games not only because of the fun it presents with my friends, but also because it allows any strees or worries to evaporate. In my nieghrbood, I was always running with my friends and took notice that I was some what quick compared to my friends. So, my love for running developed fairly young.</p>
    <H2> Sports </H2>
    <p> As a child, I never really liked watching sports like Baseball, Soccer, and Football, but I did enjoy playing them with friends. I didn't consider sports and it was only up until highschool that I considered doing a sport. I wanted to play a sport that really emphaszied running. So I joined the track team my freshamn year of highscool. Running short distances has always been a favorite of mine and to make the experience even better, running with a team, in particular a relay team, maked running that much more competettive and fun. Another Hobby of mine is playing video games. I've been playing since the PS2 came out, and over the years I've grown to love the video game franchises. </p>
    <H2> Reptiles </H2>
    <p> Reptiles have always been a favorite of mine. When I was younger I owned a Leopard Gecko and 6 years ago I bought a 4 month old Bearded Dragon. I have always wanted a snake, however, my mom has a fear of snakes and I don't think she would be found of a ball python living in the same room as her, let alone feeding it live rodents, cleaning up its shed, and letting it slither on the floor. Before I was born, my family owned two turtles. When I'm older I want to be able to own more reptiles. </p>
